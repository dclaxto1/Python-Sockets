# Python-Sockets

I utilized my knowledge of networking sockets in Python to write a custom client/server program.

It has the following functionality:

1) Client connects to the server
2) Client and the server successfully exchange messages
3) Ability to follow the TCP stream in Wireshark
4) Identifying the message sent in Wireshark
